 - ImageMagick resource limiting
 - full command line parametrisation
 - help for command line

=======
 - resource usage limits
 
>>>>>>> .r96
Ideas (for v2.0):
 - aspect keep strength: 0 - no aspect keeping i.e. distorted, 100 - keep the aspect not changed i.e original aspect
 - hash tokens to hash the url/parameters along with shared secret to prevent changing of parameters from browser
 - timeout tokens; in combination with hash tokens could be used to set time limit of request validity
 - controllable quality and format (mime-type) form query string; needs hash tokens first
 - better logging: log level controll

Future Ideas:
 - automatic cache size controll; for e.x. always leave 5% free space on cache partition by removing oldest entries
 - video/audio thumbnailing with ffmpeg?!
 - pipe in orginal (UNIX style filter usage: cat x.jpg | cgiscaler -p -w 322 -h 203 > out.jpg )
